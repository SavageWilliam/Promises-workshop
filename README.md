# Promise-it-wont-hurt-solutions

JavaScript Solutions to intro to [promise-it-wont-hurt](https://github.com/stevekane/promise-it-wont-hurt) workshop.

I remember first learning callbacks, they totally baffled me. Now, find them fairly painless it's hard to remember how hard they were.

I found first introductions to promises have a similar conceptual barrier, hence I've shared my solutions to this highly _recommended_ workshop for anyone that find themselves a little stuck.

### Running the [workshop](https://github.com/stevekane/promise-it-wont-hurt) with npm:

```
$ mkdir promise-shop && cd promise-shop
$ npm init
$ npm install -g promise-it-wont-hurt@latest
```
